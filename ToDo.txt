Bugs / Outstanding
===================

Replace the event definitions with a proper readme type file. Also add to readme what the generic event types are.
The profiles loading tries to do everything in Profiles folder, no sanity check about file/folder type. If you make a "backup" folder in it, the program crashes without recording an error.
Look to use yaml in RCON integration configs as they may be nicer to read and may support the action commands and passing JSON to Factorio nicer.
Should I just ignore any event without an ID string? Came up ages ago during Will's playthrough. But not enough of an issue to be done at the time.
If you close the GUI when internet is dead after being connected via RCON the python window never closes. Guess its waiting for something to close.
Change profile loading to not error on startup for bad profiles, but error on trying to start them.


Ideas
===============

Make a settings manager GUI
Make a profile manager GUI
Make so that profile startup errors are shown in a GUI and disable running until fixed.
Have separate Activity and System (status, warning, errors) logs
Have a way to pause logs from updating and then resume to allow scrolling
Support multiple calculated values via exec. Array in to exec, to numbered strings in action script.
Handle paused Factorio server accepting but not reply to RCON command. It will honour the command when the server is un-paused. So different between start test connection and event handling.
Add a more complete test GUI with options to select subscription types, donation currencies, etc.
Look at supporting Twitch PubSub directly so I can get the Channel Points. May also open up other opportunities: https://github.com/twitchdev/pubsub-samples/tree/1638781c0c096c4be43493a86f2a75401256583b/python
