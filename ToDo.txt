Bugs / Outstanding
===================

Back in commit 402ff1a0a6efe40532fb6e523184eb4f974e0c92 I changed it so that both bespoke reactions and generic reactions ran for the same event. This was a mistake and I did it as a simple fix for what JD wanted to do at the time. I should reverse this change and add a new option for this type of usage case. As its breaking standard behavior for more normal usage scenarios. Also I never updated all the Readme for it. I am not sure if this comment refers to checking the platform and type as well as generic ones, or if it relates to being able to run more than 1 action. The more than 1 action is actually very useful, although still not properly documented. The example profiles don't look to match up to this, as well as possibly some of the historic profiles checked in. This was done to allow multiple RCON commands to be run in response to an event. It looks like I did this over making action an Array for unknown reasons, as it means you need the same condition for each extra action you want for a command. This needs proper reviewing and settling. Less changes at this point seems the better.
I couldn't use negative filtering by type on a money reaction: [TYPE] != 'subscription' and [TYPE] != 'subMysteryGift'
Document that you can add comments within the profile if you want. The tool never looks for a "comment" key in the JSON. The tool only looks for the documented keys in the JSON with anything else being  ignored.
Replace the event definitions with a proper readme type file. Also add to readme what the generic event types are.
The profiles loading tries to do everything in Profiles folder, no sanity check about file/folder type. If you make a "backup" folder in it, the program crashes without recording an error.
Look to use yaml in RCON integration configs as they may be nicer to read and may support the action commands and passing JSON to Factorio nicer.
Should I just ignore any event without an ID string? Came up ages ago during Will's play through. But not enough of an issue to be done at the time.
If you close the GUI when internet is dead after being connected via RCON the python window never closes. Guess its waiting for something to close.
Change profile loading to not error on startup for bad profiles, but error on trying to start them.
Document that to call a named `action` in the `reactions` you need to pre-fix it with ACTION_, i.e. ACTION_myActionName. The `actions` array `name` field stays as just the name, i.e. myActionName. It must also be wrapped in "[]" just like any other special field. The `effect` of the shared action will only accept `ALL` type fields, so can't use any event type specific fields.
Correct "twitchMysterSubGiftMode" to not have a typo in it, readme and code. Add a changelog note for it and also make it error if the old bad spelling is in a config to ensure users update and thus get their desired setting.
Lots of internal code typos throughout the project that need updating.



Ideas
===============

Make a settings manager GUI
Make a profile manager GUI
Make so that profile startup errors are shown in a GUI and disable running until fixed.
Have separate Activity and System (status, warning, errors) logs
Have a way to pause logs from updating and then resume to allow scrolling
Support multiple calculated values via exec. Array in to exec, to numbered strings in action script.
Handle paused Factorio server accepting but not reply to RCON command. It will honour the command when the server is un-paused. So different between start test connection and event handling.
Add a more complete test GUI with options to select subscription types, donation currencies, etc.
Look at supporting Twitch PubSub directly so I can get the Channel Points. May also open up other opportunities: https://github.com/twitchdev/pubsub-samples/tree/1638781c0c096c4be43493a86f2a75401256583b/python
